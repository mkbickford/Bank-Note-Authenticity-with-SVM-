The Banknote Authentication dataset tracks trends in four features of paper currency: variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy. These features predict with high accuracy whether a banknote is authentic currency or forged. While the original parameters of the dataset were well-tuned, I wanted to test whether I could make them even better. Using Support Vector Machines and a gridsearch, I discovered the best 'C' value, 'gamma' value, and 'kernel' to adjust the model parameters even more and yield results for banknote authenticity that were 100% accurate (as determined by the final confusion matrix and classification report).
